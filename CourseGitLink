Pick two things in dataset youd like to predict
Identify: Is this classification or regression problem.

Depedning on the type of problem you choose will change next step:

How would you measure the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm:
You have to choose an evaluation metric:
Classifciation: accuracy, precision, recall...
Regression: RMSE, mean absolute error, lots of metrics you can use (Jake likes those two)
Pick and explain:
We would like to classify/regression on the following two items:

We know we mined useful things using cross validation/some other metric
