    "This section was completely re-worked based on the feedback from the first submission.  The outline of this section was completed to include details on our chosen CV metric for both our classification task and our regression task.  We informed the reader of the validation metrics as well as how we aim to interpret and evaluate our model performance.  In terms of actual coding, we used this section to include CV code matching our chosen method.  This CV code is now referenced throughout the document and becuause of these changes our code is more consistent and human readable.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Section modifed heavily to match project specifications.  Section is broken into two main parts, the first part creates three different regression models for each task.  The models are: LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic net.  The second part creates three different classification models for each task.  Those models are: KNN, Random Forest, and Gaussian Navie Bayes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Section completely re-done to fit feedback and project specifications.  Like prior sections this is broken into two distinct parts, the first being related to the regression task and the second is related to the classification task.  Within modeling and evaluation two, we built the models and gave each model the ability to have it's paramters adjusted, and we learned which paramter adjustments led to the best model performance.  These paramters and models were brought into modeling and evaluation IV for analysis and comparison.  Each model was visualized (regression task displayed a table of CV results and different metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAPE) and classification task displayed plots of within class accuracy (displaying how each algorithm correctly classfied on-time and not-on-time flights.  I explained why each model was useful and disucssed trade offs between performance and accuracy.  The best performing regression model was LASSO with a MSE of around 40.0, and the best performing classification algorithm was random forest with an accuracy around 72% (this did NOT meet our metric for success (that was 0.8).  But we explained that despite this fact, the models were still much better than randomly guessing if a flight was delayed on arrival or not.  \n",

This is gate-to-gate time (meaning the timer on this starts once the airplane leaves departure the gate, and stops when the plane arrives at its destination gate.

This metric is a good first pass at evaluating a models performance, its simple and quick.  The mean absolute error howeer, does not indicate under/over performance in the model.  The residuals all contribute proportionally, so larger errors will contribute significantally to the model.  A small MAE is a good indicator of good prediction and a large MAE indicates the model may need more work.  MAE of 0 is ideal, but not really possible. The MAE is farily robust to outliers since it uses the absolute value.  For this model a lower MAE is \"better.\"  This metric is appropriate since we are concerned with the models ability to predict delay times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Root mean squared error is the standard deviation of the residuals (commonly known as prediction errrors).  We use these rediuals to see how far from the line the points are.  RMSE is a good metric to tell us how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.  The nice and differentiating part of RMSE is that they can be positive or negative as the predicted value under or over the estimates of the actual value unlike the MAE and MAPE which use the absolute value.  Additionally we can use the RMSE as a good measure of the spread of the y values about the predicted y values.  \n",

    "Mean absolute percentage error is being used as the percentage equivalent of MAE.  Similarily to the MAE, MAPE measures how far our model's predictions are off from their corresponding outputs on average.  MAPE is pretty easy to interpret because of its use of percentages.  As a downside, MAPE is undefined for data where we have 0 values.  The MAPE can also grow very large if the values themselves are small, and as a final note MAPE is biased towards predictions that are systematically less than actual values.  We will use MAPE as a more interpretable MAE.    \n",
    "We will interpret the MAPE in terms of percentages,  as an example the MAPE will state, \"our model's predictions are on average xx% off from the actual value.\"  This metric is appropriate since we are concerned with the model's ability to predict delay times, furthermore the addition of percentage will further our ability to interpret the model's performance.  \n",

We will also used a random seed set to \"45\" to us ethe same test and training split are used each time we cross validation.

    "## How useful is our model for interested parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has an appliation for two parties; air travelers and airlines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address air travelers, our model can be useful in several ways.  The model can be used to evaluate an airlines overall ability to generally deliver passengers to their destination in the promised amount of time.  Furthermore, passengers can use this model to look at the different airlines, origins, and time of year to help determine the likelyhood of their flight arriving at its destination on time.  The classification model can be used to tell a passenger if, given a set of inputs for their flight, their flight will classify as on time or not.  The regression model can be used to determine how late their arriving flight will be given a set of inputs like airline, delay type, and time of year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address airlines, our model can be useful in several ways.  Airlines can use this model to look at where, when, and how certain flights from origins end up arrving at their destinations delayed.  They can use this information to update their schedules and work on their operational reliability in terms of delivering passengers in the promised time slot.  Airlines can use the classification model to investiate which flights arrive late, and with that information they can dig deeper into the causes of those arrival delays.  The airlines can use the regression models to determine which delay types are most impactful on getting aircraft to their destinations in a timely fashion (The outcome is delay length, a good question they could as is, \"what is the most impactful delay type (security,weather, NAS), that causes our flights to arrive late?).  They can also use this model to investiagte seasonality of delays and investigate questions like, \"Are weather delays longer during winter months?\" Or \"Does do NAS delays occur more often in summertime?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How would we deploy our models?\n",
    "\n",
    "We belive that this model could be deployed into a production environment of an airlines scheduling opeartions center.  The airline could create the new proposed schedule and run it through the classification model and look at which flights have high potential to not arrive on time.  They could then use our regression model to look at seasonality and how a delay would impact the ability for a flight to arrive on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can also be used on the consumer side to help consumers make informed decisions about which flights to take.  Maybe they have a very important meeting and want to see if they can make their meeting given that for example their United flight has a carrier or weather delay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What other data should be collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "We feel that the data collected is more than adequate.  If we could add one variable we would like to see the inclusion of aircraft type as this could shed some light on questions like, are larger aircraft more often arriving late? Or are smaller aircraft more asscoiated with carrier delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How often does the model need to be updated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally this model would be updated yearly as the DOT releases its yearly statistics for the airline industry.  This task could almost certainly be automated and integrated into the rest of the data.  This process is a solid way to update the data since the variables or collection metrics will not change over time as they all need to be captured to evaluate airlines.  "
